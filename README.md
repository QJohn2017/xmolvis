# xmolvis
Fast visualization for molecular dynamics and ab-initio simulations.

This project is a fork of **xmolview** to update and optimize the code.

To compile **xmolvis** follow the instructions as in the **xmolview** project:

https://github.com/eetorres/xmolview

The **xmolvis** uses directly keyboard commands.

Open an structure file and try the folowing 1 key commands:

1. v (volume)
2. s (atomic symbols)
3. f (fragments)
4. t (tools)
5. k (control panel)
